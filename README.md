# Sliding Tile Puzzle in PDDL 2.0

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to solve some instances of the sliding tile puzzle with the aid of AI Planning techniques. 
In particular, the work focuses on developing a domain and some instances of the problem in PDDL.
The presentation is organized as follows. Firstly, it presents the approach used during the development phases. Secondly, it provides an overview about the domain and the problem instances, with documentation of the PDDL domain file and description of the domains utilized as reference. Thirdly, the planners selected for the assignment are briefly described, along with some quick information about the compilation / build phases and the CLI launch commands for solving the problems. Lastly, the results of the planning tasks are proposed along with a critical analysis of what is obtained.
